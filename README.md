**Autonomous swarm agents for early on-chain signal detection**

Eremos is a lightweight framework for deploying modular agents that monitor blockchain activity - tracking wallet clusters, mint patterns, and contract anomalies.
Designed for devs who want low-noise, early signals embedded into their workflows.

  <em>Theron - Agent (000)</em>
</p>

**Meet Theron - Agent-000**  
*The first deployed agent in the swarm. Passive. Pattern-sensitive.  
Modular and extendable by design.*


**Agent-001 Coming Soon** [Teaser](https://x.com/EremosCore/status/1949154939923833239)

## Features

- **Modular Agents** - Scoped logic for detecting wallet activity, contract spawns, and anomalies  
- **Signal Emission** - Structured signals for logging, alerting, or downstream use  
- **Swarm Design** - Each agent operates independently with shared utilities  
- **Extensible Core** - Plug in watchers, inference layers, or custom triggers  
- **Minimal Output** - Log only what matters
- **Launch Wallet Detection** - Agents can trace freshly funded wallets (e.g. from CEXs), track their contract interactions, and flag high-confidence deploys in real time
- **Ghost Watcher** - Monitors long-dormant wallets that suddenly become active again. Useful for tracing old dev wallets or rug setups.

## Example Signal

An example signal emitted by an agent detecting a live token deployment:

```ts
[agent-observer] â†’ fresh funding detected from kraken (wallet: 6Yxk...P2M8) at 04:41:12Z
[agent-observer] â†’ contract probing detected within 4s (pump.fun interaction traced)
[agent-observer] â†’ token created at 04:41:17Z (tx: 5gW...pump)
[agent-observer] â†’ 5 bundle-linked wallets interacted within 8s of deploy
[agent-observer] â†’ launch confidence spike (0.91) - emitting signal (elapsed: 13s)

{
  agent: "Observer",
  type: "launch_detected",
  glyph: "Î”",
  hash: "sig_c7f9a3d2bc",
  timestamp: "2025-06-12T04:41:25Z",
  source: "agent-observer",
  confidence: 0.91
}
```

---

## Signal Confidence

Each emitted signal includes a `confidence` score (0â€“1) based on behavioral heuristics:
- CEX-origin funding (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase)
- Time between funding â†’ deploy
- Wallet linkage density (bundled activity)
- Token metadata validation

Confidence is computed via agent-side scoring and logged alongside the signal.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (typed logic across agents, utils, and infra)
- **Runtime:** Node.js (TypeScript-based agent runner)
- **Testing:** Jest with TypeScript support
- **Linting:** ESLint with Prettier formatting
- **Chain Layer:** RPC watchers, mempool filters, native triggers
